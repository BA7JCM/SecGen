# Security Scenario Generator (SecGen)

## Summary
SecGen creates vulnerable virtual machines, lab environments, and hacking challenges, so students can learn security penetration testing techniques.

Boxes like Metasploitable2 are always the same, this project uses Vagrant, Puppet, and Ruby to create randomly vulnerable virtual machines that can be used for learning or for hosting CTF events.

## Introduction
Computer security students benefit from engaging in hacking challenges. Practical lab work and pre-configured hacking challenges are common practice both in security education and also as a pastime for security-minded individuals. Competitive hacking challenges, such as capture the flag (CTF) competitions have become a mainstay at industry conferences and are the focus of large online communities. Virtual machines (VMs) provide an effective way of sharing targets for hacking, and can be designed in order to test the skills of the attacker. Websites such as Vulnhub host pre-configured hacking challenge VMs and are a valuable resource for those learning and advancing their skills in computer security. However, developing these hacking challenges is time consuming, and once created, essentially static. That is, once the challenge has been "solved" there is no remaining challenge for the student, and if the challenge is created for a competition or assessment, the challenge cannot be reused without risking plagiarism, and collusion.

Security Scenario Generator (SecGen) generates randomised vulnerable systems. VMs are created based on a scenario specification, which describes the constraints and properties of the VMs to be created. For example, a scenario could specify the creation of a system with a remotely exploitable vulnerability that would result in user-level compromise, and a locally exploitable flaw that would result in root-level compromise. This would require the attacker to discover and exploit both randomly selected vulnerabilities in order to obtain root access to the system. Alternatively, the scenario that is defined can be more specific, specifying certain kinds of services (such as FTP or SMB) or even exact vulnerabilities (by CVE).

SecGen is a Ruby application, with an XML configuration language. SecGen reads its configuration, including the available vulnerabilities, services, networks, users, and content, reads the definition of the requested scenario, applies logic for randomising the scenario, and leverages Puppet and Vagrant to provision the required VMs.

SecGen contains modules, which install various software packages. Each SecGen module may contain or remotely source software, and each module defines its own license in the accompanying secgen_metadata.xml file.

## Installation
SecGen is developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux. In theory, SecGen should run on Mac or Windows, if you have all the required software installed.

You will need to install the following:
- Ruby (development): https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
- Vagrant: http://www.vagrantup.com/
- Virtual Box: https://www.virtualbox.org/
- Puppet: http://puppet.com/
- Packer: https://www.packer.io/
- ImageMagick: https://www.imagemagick.org/
- And the required Ruby Gems (including Nokogiri and Librarian-puppet)

This project has been adapted to work with the Ubuntu (20.04) release due to (16.04) coming to end of life as of April 2021, though it will still work on that version it is not guaranteed to support the security updates needed for your development environment.


### On Ubuntu (20.04) these commands will get you up and running

Ensure Ubuntu is updated using the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
Install a recent version of vagrant:
```bash
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.9/vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb
sudo apt install ./vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb
```
Install other required packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev build-essential patch virtualbox ruby-bundler imagemagick libmagickwand-dev exiftool libpq-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev graphviz graphviz-dev libpcap0.8-dev git
```
Clone the SecGen repo using the following command.By default this will be /home/username/SecGen, change as required:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cliffe/SecGen.git
```
Install gems using the following commands:
```bash
#Step In to the file directory

cd /home/username/SecGen

bundle update --bundler
```
Update gems:
```bash
bundle update
```

### On Ubuntu (16.04) these commands will get you up and running
Install all the required packages:
```bash
# install a recent version of vagrant
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.9.8/vagrant_1.9.8_x86_64.deb
sudo apt install ./vagrant_1.9.8_x86_64.deb
# install other required packages via repos
sudo apt-get install ruby-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev build-essential patch virtualbox ruby-bundler imagemagick libmagickwand-dev exiftool libpq-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libxml2-dev graphviz graphviz-dev libpcap0.8-dev git
```

Copy SecGen to a directory of your choosing, such as */home/user/bin/SecGen*

Then install gems:
```bash
cd /home/user/bin/SecGen
bundle install
```

To use the Windows basesboxes you will need to install Packer. Use the following command:
```bash
curl -SL https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.2/packer_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip -o packer_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip
unzip packer_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv packer /usr/local/
sudo bash -c 'echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:/usr/local/\"" >> /etc/environment'
sudo vagrant plugin install winrm
sudo vagrant plugin install winrm-fs
```

## Usage
Basic usage:
```bash
ruby secgen.rb run
```
This will use the default scenario to randomly generate VM(s).
![gify goodness](lib/resources/images/readme_gifs/secgen_default_scenario_run.gif  "SecGen randomising a vulnerable VM -- part 1, randomisation")
![gify goodness](lib/resources/images/readme_gifs/secgen_default_scenario_run_vm.gif  "SecGen randomising a vulnerable VM -- part 2, provisioning VMs")

## Troubleshooting: updating base boxes
If SecGen experiences errors installing packages, the template VMs (base boxes) we publish on Vagrant cloud may need updating (especially Kali, which is a rolling-release). After you have built some VMs, browse in your home directory `.vagrant.d/boxes/`, from here you can manually launch the VMs that are used as templates, and apply software updates `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade`. Then power down the VM, and try SecGen again.

For Proxmox, use this Vagrant plugin: https://github.com/cliffe/vagrant-proxmox/, and make this fix to Vagrant: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/pull/12463/files. 

You will typically need to create a Debian Buster base VM, broadly following these instructions:
https://github.com/cliffe/SecGen/blob/master/README-Creating-Bases.md

## Scenarios
SecGen generates VMs based on a scenario specification, which describes the constraints and properties of the VMs to be created.

### Using existing scenarios
Existing scenarios make SecGen's barrier for entry low: when invoking SecGen, a scenario can be specified as a command argument, and SecGen will then read the appropriate scenario definition and go about randomisation and VM generation. This removes the requirement for end users of the framework to understand SecGen's configuration specification.

Scenarios can be found in the scenarios/ directory. For example, to spin up a VM that has a random remotly exploitable vulnerability that results in user-level compromise:
```bash
   ruby secgen.rb --scenario scenarios/examples/remotely_exploitable_user_vulnerability.xml run
```
![gify goodness](lib/resources/images/readme_gifs/secgen_random_example.gif  "Remotely exploitable example where an attacker ends up with user-level access")

#### VMs for a security audit of an organisation
To generate a set of VMs for a randomly generated fictional organisation, with a desktop system, webserver, and intranet server:
```bash
   ruby secgen.rb --scenario scenarios/security_audit/team_project.xml run
```
Note that the intranet server has a security remit, with instructions on performing a security audit of these systems. The desktop system can access the intranet to access the remit, but the attacker VM (for example, Kali) can be connected to the NIC only shared by the Web server to simulate the need to pivot attacks through the Web server, as they can't connect to the intranet system directly. The "marking guide" is in the form of the output scenario.xml in the project directory, which provides the details of the systems generated.

#### VMs for a CTF event
To generate a set of VMs for a CTF competition:
```bash
   ruby secgen.rb --scenario scenarios/ctf/flawed_fortress_1.xml run
```
Note that a 'CTFd_importable.zip' file is also generated, containing all the flags and hints, which you can import into the [CTFd scoreboard frontend](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd).
This is compatible with CTFd v2.0.2 and newer.

**Default admin account:**
Username: adminusername
Password: adminpassword

### Defining new scenarios
Writing your own scenarios enables you to define a VM or set of VMs with a configuration as specific or general as desired.

SecGen's scenario specification is a powerful interface for specifying the constraints of the vulnerable systems to generate. Scenarios are defined in XML configuration files that specify systems in terms of a base, services/utilities, vulnerabilities, and networks.

For details please see the **[Creating Scenarios guide](README-Creating-Scenarios.md)**.

## Modules
SecGen is designed to be easily extendable with modules that define vulnerabilities and other kinds of software, configuration, and content changes.

The types of modules supported in SecGen are:
 - base: a SecGen module that defines the OS platform (VM template) used to build the VM
 - vulnerability: a SecGen module that adds an insecure, hackable, state (including realistic software vulnerabilities known to be in the wild or fabricated hacking challenges)
 - service: a SecGen module that adds a (relatively secure) network service
 - utility: a SecGen module that adds (relatively secure) software or configuration changes
 - network: a virtual network card
 - generator: generates output, such as random text
 - encoder: receives input, such as text, performs operations on that to produce output (such as, encoding/encryption/selection)

Each vulnerability module is contained within the modules/vulnerabilies directory tree, which is organised to match the Metasploit Framework (MSF) modules directory structure. For example, the distcc_exec vulnerability module is contained within: modules/vulnerabilities/unix/misc/distcc_exec/.

The root of the module directory always contains a secgen_metadata.xml file and also contains puppet files, which are used to make a system vulnerable.

For details please see the **[Modules Metadata guide](README-Modules-Metadata.md)**.

### Generators and encoders create and alter content
Encoders and generators have code that is *evaluated at project build time*, such as encoding text, and generating flags and other potentially randomised content. In each case, this is a ruby script located within the module directory in **local/secgen_local.rb**. Although normally called by SecGen, secgen_local.rb scripts can be executed directly, and accept all the parameter inputs as command line arguments, and returns the output in JSON format to stdout. Other human readable output is written to stderr.

```bash
#ruby modules/encoders/string/base64/secgen_local/local.rb --strings_to_encode "encode this" --strings_to_encode "and this"
BASE64 Encoder
 Encoding '["encode this", "and this"]'
 Encoded: ["ZW5jb2RlIHRoaXM=", "YW5kIHRoaXM="]
["ZW5jb2RlIHRoaXM=","YW5kIHRoaXM="]
```
![gify goodness](lib/resources/images/readme_gifs/base64_encoder_run.gif  "secgen_local.rb scripts can be executed directly")
![gify goodness](lib/resources/images/readme_gifs/base64_encoder_code.gif  "Coding a generator or encoder is easy!")

## Puppet is used to provision the VMs
Each vulnerability, service, and utility module contains Puppet files which are used to provision the software and configuration changes onto the VMs. By the time Puppet is executed to provision VMs, all randomisation has previously taken place at build time.

For details please see the **[Modules Puppet guide](README-Modules-Puppet.md)**.

## SecGen project output
By default output is to 'projects/SecGen_*[CurrentTime]*/'

The project output includes:
 - A Vagrant configuration for spinning up the boxes.
 - A directory containing all the required puppet modules for the above. A Librarian-Puppet file is created to manage modules, and some required modules may be obtained via PuppetForge, and therefore an Internet connection is required when building the project.
 - A de-randomised scenario XML file. Using SecGen you can use this 'scenario.xml' file to recreate the above Vagrant config and puppet files. Any randomisation that has been applied should be un-randomised in this output (compared to the original scenario file). This file contains all the details of the systems created, and can also be used later for grading, scoring, or giving hints.
 - A 'flag_hints.xml' file, containing all the flags along with multiple hints per flag.
 - A 'CTFd_importable.zip' file useful for CTF events, for import into the [CTFd scoreboard frontend](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd).

If you start SecGen with the "build-project" (or "p") command it creates the above files and then stops. The "run" (or "r") command creates the project files then uses Vagrant to build the VM(s).

It is possible to copy the project directory to any compatible system with Vagrant, and simply run "vagrant up" to create the VMs.

The default root password for the base-boxes is 'puppet', but this may be modified by SecGen depending on the scenario used.

## Batch Processing with SecGen

Generating multiple VMs in a batch is now possible through the use of batch_secgen, which manages a job queue to mass-create VMs with SecGen. There are helper commands available to add jobs, list jobs in the table, remove jobs, and reset the status of jobs from 'running' or 'error' to 'todo'.

For details please see the **[Batch Creation of VMs guide](README-Batch-VMs.md)**.

## CyBOK Knowledge Area Key

The Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) is a body of knowledge that aims to encapsulate the various knowledge areas present within cyber security.
Scenarios within SecGen now contain XML elements linking them to CyBOK knowledge areas and specific topics within those knowledge areas.
Additionally, video content for scenarios are tagged with CyBOK associations.

For an index of lab scenarios in SecGen organised by CyBOK Knowledge Areas please see the **[Lab Scenarios and CyBOK](README-CyBOK-Scenarios-Indexed.md)**. Likewise, for **[CTF scenarios](README-CyBOK-CTF-Scenarios-Indexed.md)**.

For a list of lecture and demo videos with CyBOK metadata please see the **[Lecture Videos and CyBOK](README-CyBOK-Lecture-Videos.md)**.

The table below is a key for the abbreviations you will find within the CyBOK XML elements within the scenarios:
