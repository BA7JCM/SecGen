# Lab Scenarios and CyBOK

The Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) is a body of knowledge that aims to encapsulate the various knowledge areas present within cyber security. Scenarios within SecGen now contain XML elements linking them to CyBOK knowledge areas and specific topics within those knowledge areas. Additionally, video lectures for scenarios are tagged with CyBOK associations.

This file is an autogenerated index and cross referencing of the 118 SecGen practical lab scenarios that have CyBOK metadata.

You can browse the list below in terms of the [CyBOK Knowledge Areas, and Topics](#scenarios-indexed-by-cybok-knowledge-area-ka). The [list of scenarios](#scenario-cybok-keywords) in the second half of this document includes keywords (also known as "indicative topics" in CyBOK terminology).

> The all lowercase topics and keywords are provided by NCSC for CyBOK mapping, while all caps indicates it is taken from the [CyBOK mapping reference](https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/CyBOk-mapping-reference-v1.1.pdf), mixed case keywords are ones that we have added.

|Name | Let's Go Phishing |
|Description | </br>     Introduction</br>    Humans play a crucial role in the cyber security of systems and information. Many attacks target users and their mental models of cyber security systems and risk. For example, if an attacker can trick a user into performing tasks for them, the attacker can achieve their goals and gain access that they are not authorised to. Human behavior often serves as both the first line of defense and the weakest link. This lab delves into the critical role humans play in safeguarding systems and information. It highlights the fact that even the most robust technical defenses can be compromised due to human error and deception. This lab primarily focuses on a pervasive cyber threat - phishing attacks. Phishing, an artful manipulation of human psychology, lures individuals into compromising security by tricking them into revealing sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or installing malware. Through this hands-on exercise, you will gain insights into how attackers exploit human vulnerabilities, learn the tactics used to craft convincing phishing emails, and explore techniques to create malicious attachments that can compromise a user's system.</br></br>    In this lab, you will embark on a simulated cybersecurity mission within a fictitious organization. Your objective is to browse the organization's website to gather information on employees, email addresses, and their potential interests. You will then employ the tactics of engagement by sending targeted phishing emails to these individuals, using techniques such as spoofing emails, creating malicious attachments (executable programs, LibreOffice documents with macros), and more. As your victims respond to your emails, they will reveal why they trust or distrust your messages, providing invaluable feedback. The ultimate goal is to persuade these users to open the malicious attachments, granting you remote access to their systems. Your mission culminates in accessing the coveted "flag" files hidden in each victim's home directory, which you will submit as proof of your success. This lab offers a unique opportunity to understand how cybersecurity threats exploit human psychology, providing a practical foundation to enhance cyber awareness and strengthen defenses against these deceptive tactics.</br>   |

|Description | </br>     Introduction</br>    This lab focuses on the critical aspect of contingency planning in the context of cybersecurity and data management. It highlights the importance of maintaining data availability and system reliability, especially when dealing with potential disasters and security incidents. The lab delves into practical strategies for creating reliable backups, understanding recovery procedures, and implementing backup solutions using the powerful rsync command.</br></br>    In this lab, you will learn how to utilize SSH/SCP for secure file transfer, create full, differential, and incremental backups using the rsync tool, and employ backups for efficient data protection. You will also explore the concept of snapshot backups, which allow for efficient storage of data by using hard links to unchanged files. Throughout the lab, you will engage in hands-on tasks such as copying directories, performing backups, restoring files, and setting up remote backups. By completing these exercises, you will gain valuable skills in contingency planning and data backup strategies, which are essential for maintaining the availability and security of critical systems and data.</br></br>    This is a Hackerbot lab. The labsheet is available once you claim a set of VMs. Work through the labsheet, then when prompted interact with Hackerbot.</br></br>     Tips for the lab</br></br>    [This resource is really really useful for understanding what happens when using Rsync depending on whether you include or don't include a slash at the end of a path, which often catches people out.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220703112235/http://qdosmsq.dunbar-it.co.uk/blog/2013/02/rsync-to-slash-or-not-to-slash/)</br></br>    This lab needs to be completed in order.</br></br>    Manually check you have done your backups correctly before telling Hackerbot you are ready. It may be a good idea to ssh to your backup server in a separate console tab ssh IP-ADDRESS (but do keep an eye on which system you are running each command on!).</br></br>    Keep an eye on the trailing slashes in rsync commands and how it changes the behaviour (the difference between copying a directory or it's contents).</br></br>    Each time you can test that your rsync command is going to do what you expect by adding -n to the command, which does a "Dry Run" without making any of the actual changes -- once you are happy it's making the changes you expect, run it again without the -n</br></br>   |

|Description | </br>     Introduction</br>    In this lab, you will develop your knowledge of memory protections and exploit techniques. The focus is on bypassing the Non-Executable (NX) stack protection, which aims to prevent attackers from running malicious code on the stack. You'll explore the theoretical concept of NX stack protection, understand how it is implemented in Linux, and learn about return-to-libc attacks, a clever exploit technique that allows you to redirect a program's execution to functions within the Standard C Library (libc) without executing any external code.</br></br>    Throughout this lab, you will learn how to bypass NX stack protection and write return-to-libc exploits. You will find the offset for the Instruction Pointer (EIP), identify the memory addresses of essential functions like execve() and exit() within libc, and construct a fake stack frame to trigger a shell using these functions. As practical tasks, you will write a Metasploit exploit module, analyze memory addresses, and run your exploit to successfully gain control over a vulnerable program.</br></br>    The CTF challenges are similar to those from the last topic, however the vulnerable software has been compiled with stack protections and non-executable stack, which you will learn to circumvent.</br>   |

|Name | Access Control Lists (ACLs) lab |
|Description | </br>     Introduction</br>    Access Control Lists (ACLs) are sets of rules attached to resources, specifying which subjects (users or entities) are authorized to access the resource and the type of permissions granted to each subject. ACLs allow for a granular and flexible approach to managing who can access a file, what kind of access they have, and how these permissions are inherited and checked.</br></br>    You will learn about the fundamental concepts of Full ACLs, their syntax and usage on Linux systems, and how they differ from traditional Unix file permissions. Through hands-on tasks, you will set ACLs on files, manipulate permissions for specific users, explore the mask entry's role in determining maximum permissions, and understand the behavior of access checks in ACLs. Additionally, you will discover the concept of default ACLs and their impact on newly created files within a directory. By comparing Linux ACLs to Windows ACLs, you'll gain insights into the unique features and nuances of each system, such as inheritance logic and the use of global security identifiers. This lab will equip you with practical skills and knowledge to manage access control effectively in a diverse range of computing environments.</br></br>     Hackerbot and CTF challenges</br>    This is a Hackerbot lab. The labsheet is available once you claim a set of VMs. Work through the labsheet, then when prompted interact with Hackerbot.</br></br>    The Hackerbot tasks involve creating and managing files and directories using Linux ACLs to control access, allowing specific users to read and write while denying access to others.

|Name | Advanced SQL injection |
|Description | </br> Introduction</br>In this web security lab you will delve into the intricacies of injection attacks, focusing on OS command injection and automated SQL injection. The lab begins by simulating OS command injection in a simple C application, demonstrating how unvalidated user input can lead to potential system shell exploitation. Subsequently, you will explore OS command injection in a PHP application, uncovering the risks associated with unfiltered user input in web environments. The lab sheet then introduces automated SQL injection using sqlmap, a penetration testing tool designed to detect and exploit SQL vulnerabilities efficiently.</br></br>Throughout the lab, you will engage with various vulnerable environments, including Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA), OWASP WebGoat, and OWASP Security Shepherd. Practical tasks include exploiting SQL injection in DVWA with different security levels, automating SQL injection attacks using sqlmap, and tackling blind SQL injection scenarios. Additionally, you will apply your knowledge to WebGoat, a web application specifically designed for learning security concepts, and complete CTF challenges in Security Shepherd. By the end of the lab, you will have gained hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating OS command injection and SQL injection vulnerabilities, crucial skills for securing web applications in real-world scenarios.</br>     |

|Name | Cross-Site Request Forgery |
|Description | </br> Introduction</br>In this web security lab focused on Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), you will delve into the intricacies of a prevalent attack that exploits the trust websites have in their users. CSRF, also known as session riding, involves users unknowingly sending requests to services they are logged into, utilizing their session cookies and other identifying information. The lab employs resources such as Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA), OWASP WebGoat and WebWolf, and CTF via OWASP Security Shepherd. The theoretical foundation covers the distinction between XSS and CSRF, emphasizing CSRF's exploitation of user trust to execute state-changing transactions. The lab introduces you to tools like Zap and WebWolf, guiding you through various exercises in WebGoat and DVWA to simulate and understand CSRF attacks at different security levels.</br></br>Throughout the lab, you will engage in hands-on tasks that mirror real-world scenarios. For instance, you'll create an external form using vi text editor, host it with WebWolf, and understand the parameters necessary for a POST request. In DVWA challenges, you'll manipulate HTML forms to exploit vulnerabilities at low, medium, and high security levels. The tasks also extend to combining CSRF with XSS to overcome anti-CSRF measures. By the end of the lab, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of CSRF attacks, CORS limitations, and practical skills in executing and defending against such attacks, enhancing your expertise in web application security.</br>     |
