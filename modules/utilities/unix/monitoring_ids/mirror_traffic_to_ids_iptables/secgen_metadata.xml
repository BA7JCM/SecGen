  <name>Mirror traffic to IDS via IPtables rules</name>

  <description>
    Forwards all INCOMING traffic to an IDS, such as Snort.
    This approach means no special networking is required to get monitoring working.
    However, because each VM only fowards on the traffic it RECEIVES, all VMs in
    the scenario (including attackers) need this module, so that the IDS sees
    all the traffic.
    Snort needs checksums set to none.
    Uses IPtables TEE feature.
