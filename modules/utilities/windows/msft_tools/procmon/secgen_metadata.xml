  <description>Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. 
  It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, 
  comprehensive event properties such as session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, 
  and much more.</description>
