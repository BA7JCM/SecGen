# Access Controls: Set User ID (SUID)

## Getting started
### VMs in this lab

==Start these VMs== (if you haven't already):
- hackerbot_server (leave it running, you don't log into this)
- desktop (you can sudo to get superuser access)
- server (<%= $server_ip %>, you can ssh to this machine, but you don't have superuser access)

### Your login details for the "desktop" and "server" VMs
User 1: <%= $main_user %>
Password: tiaspbiqe2r (**t**his **i**s **a** **s**ecure **p**assword **b**ut **i**s **q**uite **e**asy **2** **r**emember)

User 2: <%= $second_user %>
Password: <%= $second_password %>


You won't login to the hackerbot_server, but the VM needs to be running to complete the lab.
