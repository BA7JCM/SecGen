# Containers: Chroot and Docker

## Getting started
### VMs in this lab

==Start these VMs== (if you haven't already):
- hackerbot_server (leave it running, you don't log into this)
- desktop (you can sudo to get superuser access)
<%= if $chroot_esc_server_ip
  "- chroot_esc_server (#{$chroot_esc_server_ip})"
end %>
<%= if $docker_esc_server_ip
   "- docker_esc_server (#{$docker_esc_server_ip})"
 end %>

### Your login details for the "desktop" VM
User: <%= $main_user %>
Password: tiaspbiqe2r (**t**his **i**s **a** **s**ecure **p**assword **b**ut **i**s **q**uite **e**asy **2** **r**emember)

You won't login to the hackerbot_server, but the VM needs to be running to complete the lab.
